How to use:

When it prompts for the amount of units, provide an integer. It will not verify your input is correct. 

If you simply want the source files for the model you can open frame_creator_mdlsrc.cmd

If you want to actually create the model then use frame_creator_game.cmd. You may need to edit the game path within the cmd file.
